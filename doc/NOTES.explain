Use Cases/Audiences

  Sysadmins reading the ProFTPD syslog/SystemLog, diagnosing server (and user!)
  issues.

  Users (via FTP clients!) using the server, diagnosing their own issues/
  problems (failed to upload, failed login, failed to list directories,
  failed to download).


Theory:

  "In English, the stuff to the left of 'because' is a statement of the
   problem, including function name and function argument names/values."


  Short version (used by libexplain):

    <system call + args> " failed: <strerror text + name/number of errno>

      "open(pathname = "foo/bar", flags = O_RDONLY) failed: No such file or directory (ENOENT [2])"

  Longer version (used by libexplain):

    <system call + args> "failed with " <strerror text + name/number of errno> " because " <explanation>

      "open(pathname = "foo/bar", flags = O_RDONLY) failed with "No such file or directory (ENOENT [2])" because there is no 'bar' file in the pathname 'foo' directory"

  I'm thinking to include the goal as well:

    "tried to ${goal} but ${task} using ${args} failed with ${error} because ${explanation}"

  Context:
  Problem:
  Solution:

  OR

  Who:
    UID/user name
    GID/group name
    PID
    Remote IP address/DNS name

  What:
    Direct object:
      file/path
      socket/address/port

    What about crypto?  SSL/TLS?

  Where:
    Module
    File
    Line

  When:
    ms timestamp

  Why:


Common Problems:

  DNS resolution failure for <VirtualHost>, DefaultAddress, MasqueradeAddress
  Data transfer timeout (firewall/NAT/router settings, esp for FTPS)
  Can't create ScoreboardFile, PidFile, *Log:
    Permissions, no such directory

  pr_error_t *pr_error_create(pool *p, int err_errno);
  void pr_error_destroy(pr_error_t *err);

  int pr_error_explain_XXX(pr_error_t *err, ...);
    This is where the Error API would call out to pluggable 'explanations'
    callbacks, per XXX function.

  Error-enhanced FSIO API.  Example:

    pr_fh_t *pr_fsio_open(const char *path, int flags);

    pr_fh_t *pr_fsio_open_with_error(pool *p, const char *path, int flags,
      pr_error_t **err);

  Providing NULL pool, or NULL err pointer, means no error.

  Then, on failure, the caller would set its calling location:

    pr_error_set_location(err, &xfer_module, __FILE__, __LINE__-1);
      If err is NULL, does nothing (void func; does NOT change errno!).

    pr_error_set_goal(err, ...);
      If err is NULL, does nothing (void func; does NOT change errno!).

      Example:
        pr_error_set_goal(err, "${protocol} file upload for user ${user}");

      Think about what details the admin would want _after the fact_: who
      was it, when, what protocol, what action was the user taking, etc.

    pr_error_strerror(err, 0);
      If err is NULL, simply returns strerror(errno).

    pr_error_destroy(err);
      If err is NULL, does nothing.


Implementation:

  Use now-standard API/SPI approach, so that modules can provide their
  own functionality.  (I'm thinking mod_explain, and a way for admins to
  produce smaller binaries by omitting the module, as they need.)

  Ideally this new API would, initially (and by default) produce error
  strings/log messages that are much like the existing log messages.

  Going forward, the "presenting" of errors using a more detailed/informative
  format, e.g:

    Context: Reading file for Foo
    Problem: (akin to libexplain strings)
    Solution: advice

  Would be very nice.  Hard to do that in a SINGLE line of log text, though.

Tasks

  First, create the Error API, and start using it in the core API/modules.
  It should produce the same log messages as currently used, making it
  a transparent change.  This will also have the benefit of determining
  just which system calls, libc functions, etc need to be covered initially.

  Next, implement the SPI portion of the API, for module use.

    struct err_explain_rec {
      const char *(*explain_open)(pr_error_t *err, const char *path, int flags,
        mode_t mode);
      ...
    }

    typedef err_explain_rec pr_error_explanations_t;

    int pr_error_register_explanations(module *m, const char *name,
      pr_error_explanations *);
    int pr_error_unregister_explanations(module *m, const char *name);

  Last, hook in mod_explain.  The above API would allow a drop-in usage of
  libexplain...if it actually compiled on Mac.  Sigh.


libexplain:

  For the bulk of the work, see:

    libexplain/buffer/errno/*.c

  The thread starts with something like:

    libexplain/rename.c ->
      libexplain/errno/rename.c ->
        libexplain/message/errno/rename.c ->
          libexplain/buffer/errno/rename.c

  The libexplain/explanation.h header is where the "assembly" happens:
  turning the explanation model object into a view (e.g. a string/message).

    void explain_explanation_assemble(...)

  For implementation, see:

     libexplain/explanation/assemble*.c

  Should the Errors API use "assemble", "render", "present", "build", or maybe
  just "fmt" (for "format"), for turning the pr_error_t model into a format
  for presenting to the intended audience (log, client, etc)?

  Consider also the _layout_ of the presentation!  A layout which works well
  for some log messages may/will not work for other cases (e.g. Java's log4j
  PatternLayout class/model).

Module Thoughts

  Directives

    ExplainEngine on|off
    ExplainTable /path/to/explanations.json

  What if the strings used by mod_explain were externalized, but not (yet)
  in po/pot format?  What if, instead, they were a .json file?  This would
  reduce the size of the executable, at the cost of runtime memory.  Plus
  it would actually be easy to localize (given the right abstracting
  interface).

  [ { "rename": [
        { "errno": "EINVAL", "text": "..." },
        { "errno": "EXDEV", "text": "..." },
      ],
    },
  }
   

Other:

  xattr support for mod_mime
    read the MIME type from xattr; see lighttpd, Apache mod_mime_xattr
  xattr support for mod_digest
    read MD5 xattr?
  xattr support in mod_ls
    LIST output format with '@' symbol, and supporting options (-@).
  xattr support in mod_facts
    What about MLSD facts?  (Would need to provide a new fact,
    e.g. UNIX.xattr.NAME=hexval, one per xattr?)

  FSOptions IgnoreExtendedAttributes (for e.g. buggy clients, for both mod_sftp
    and core)

  Update Commands howto with HASH (assuming mod_digest)

  SITE XATTR commands:
    GETXATTR
    SETXATTR
    LSXATTR
    RMXATTR

    attribute name as string, attribute value as hex-encoded (lc)

    Format for LISTXATTR response?

    What about symlinks?  (i.e. use l*xattr() functions on paths, or not?)
